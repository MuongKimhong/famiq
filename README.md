## What is Famiq?
**Famiq** is a UI library wrapped around Bevy UI module by providing default
widgets and a simple way to manage styles.

Instead of writing Rust code for styling,
developers can define styles in a well known JSON file. These styles are then parsed
into Bevy's native UI styles, significantly reducing boilerplate code.

[Demo code](https://github.com/MuongKimhong/famiq/tree/master/examples/demo)

hot-reload can be enabled during development so that any changes made to the json file
are reflected immediately in the running app, no need to re-compile.
